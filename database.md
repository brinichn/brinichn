# Mock J&J database
## Iintroduction
My mock database was designed to help track the usage of J&J medical devices in South Florida between hospitals and consultants. The idea to build this database for medical devices was based on my work experience for Depuy Synthes but my skills learned in the process are not limited to the health care industry. My project below encompasses planning the database itself using an ERD, the database build, creating an application executable, and generating reports and dashboards. This project is presented to share my experience with Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Basic, SQL and T-SQL, and visual basic. Both the OLTP and OLAP database are based on the same mock data and encompass tracking medical device usage.
