# About Me
Hi I am Nicholas Brinich. I am a current fourth year student at the University of Denver expected to graduate in June 2022. I am a double major studying Business Information Analytics and marketing. Over the years at DU I have really came to love data and how it drives business decisions. It is quite fascinating how much data is out there that can be utilized to propel a business forward yet how little companies are taking advantage of this. It will be quite interesting to see how the ever-increasing data driven environment will take shape in the years to come. In terms of software and languages, I am most comfortable with SQL and TSQL. I have used SQL to create a OLTP database in SSMS and am currently working on the development of a OLAP database. My experience is not limited to SQL and SSMS as I have experience with python (Jupyterlab), Tableau, PowerBI, Power Pivot, Visual Basic and Rstudio.

Over the last two summers I have worked in the healthcare industry as an intern for Depuy Synthes. Depuy Synthes is a Johnson & Johnson company that specializes in trauma medical devices (like a plate or screw in your wrist,ouch!). While at Depuy Synthes I had the opportunity to work with real data to determine product allocations within the Denver area and overall performance across the country.

Upon graduation I would like to work as a business analyst in the marketing analytics department. I really find it fascinating how we can bring raw numbers to answers and furthermore decipher ways to attract noncustomers and how to retain current customers. Although marketing analytics would be ideal my most important trait in my early career would work on an analytics team with a strong support team. As for my work experience, it really opened my eyes to how important it is to have a mentor that pushes you to become the most efficient one can be.

# SSMS OLTP Database experience
The video below displays a mock database with mock data of how Johnson & Johnson can track their device usage across a Florida region. Medical devices are used at a rapid rate between different hospitals and J&J consultants. The point of this database is to help track each medical devices status and location. The goal for this project is to help medical devices remain restocked in inventory and do not get lost in a hospital or consultants system.
